# Statistical Analysis on King Street Pilot Project

One of the goal of the King Street Pilot project is to improve public street car travel speed and efficiency between Jarvis Street and Bathurst Street. However, vehicles are not allowed to travel through the street most of the time. As a result, the average travel time of the vehicles surrounding the area will increase. I am performing a statistical analysis on the vehicle travel time of this project between Nov. 2017 to Oct. 2018, and comparing the pilot data with the baseline data which is the vehicle travel time before the Pilot project began. 

The dataset can be found in the City Of Toronto Open Data website as shown below.

Does the pilot data satisfies under the baseline?

Let us find out. Please view my project and click the above link, "Statistical Analysis on King Street Pilot Project.ipynb" for the detailed analysis.
